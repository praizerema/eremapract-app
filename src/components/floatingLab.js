// 1k19:12- Still small voice
// voice= "qol":  it is a sound that is significant.its a sound of a language used many times for many
// a sound of a man.
// The voice will be the voice of a man

// There is no voice of God.
// Its a reguler voice that is heard in the spirit. 
// Its a regular voice(qol) that is seen as that small voice. 
// The relevance of this particular incidence will be in  
// Rom11:4 Paul mentions the answer of God 
// which is chrematizmos taken from chrematuso. 
// which has to do with an oracle. By using the word answer of God which is an utterrance, response. 
// This implies that we have a work to do. 
// to be able to identify is it God speeking or an angel. 
//  When Paul says answer of God can that qualify it to be that it is God or an angel who spoke. 
//  Rom11:4: same statement in v18. 
//  We must find out whether its an angel or God speaking.

//  Heb1:7: 
//  Whenyou say utterrance its givimg us to choose whether is God directly or a third party.
//  By using Answer of God, It could have been the utterance of God.
//  We cant specifically say that was the spirit of God.
 
//  The fact that he said God said  doesnt mean its the spirit of God that spoke to Elija.  
//  It will be left for us to decide whether its an angel of God or God.Component

//  Jh8:12- He that follows me shall have the light of life,
//  The key to direction is faith in christ.Component
//  God speaking is not direction. it is the reception the capacity to recieve that is direction.


// Follow: not the same thing as someone behind you. It has to deal with takung head to someone. "akoloutheo". to atten to someone.
// Hearing it is not following its when you listen and heed to what is being said thatis following.Component
// the statement he that follow me can also mean He that believes. 
// Light and darkness are spiritual things,. he is not talking about physical light or darkness. 
// Jh1:4- The light shines in the darkness and the darkness couldnt comprehend it. in him was life and the life was the light of men. 

// the light of life: the light that is in the life. 

// Who is the one who folows him? Jh1:12
// As many has recieved him.
// The man who is born again has the life of light.
// v9: 
// everyman- everyon thhat has recieved him.
// The key to direction is faith in christ.Component
// The key to direction is not prayer, the access to direction is not fasting. immediately you take that route, you are stepping into unbeliev

// Elijah was in between opinions.The earthquake, the fire, the wind and the still small voice.  Any christain who has this kind of experience is following his senses

// He taht believes shall not walk in darkness.
// in faith in God, there is no darkness.
// Notice again
// John9:5 As long as i am in the world, i am the light of the world
// Light: will mean to shine or put illumination on a path
// Untill faith in christ, a man walks in the path of darkness
// Darkness as touching the father
// Darkness means not knowing the father.
// The father shines the light on the son and the son reflects the  father. Its a direction from or towards the fahter

// A man that is born again has the light of life
// John10:
// background john9:39
// he is talking about the self righteousness of the pharicies.
// if you aree blind you have no sin.

// sin-- means an error.

// John10:1-10
// Notice: and when he puts up his sheep, he goes befor them and the sheep follows him because they know. 
// this is in his sacrifice. 
// The thief here is not the devil. the devil is just here by association 
// Door of his ship: is his sacrifice. 
// He was talking about giving his life for the ship(16)




// what will save is laying down his life for the sheep an that is what gives life and so what will steal , kill and destroy will be the opposite of that.
// who is the thief?
// This is a spiritual principle. 



// Whatever is the thief is 
// Whatever is the thief is what causes or who makes to do
// v5 stranger: "allotros": not yours to belongs to another.
// same thing in v8
// A stranger will be what does not speak of the sacrifice of jesus.
// the sheep did not hear will mean to heed to believe. 
// v9 the door if anyone enters it (through his sacrifice) 
// He shall be saved and go in and out to find pasture.

// pasture: same word in 2tim2:17 used twice. : means increase
// spiritual growth. 

// 1pet2:2, 2Pet3:18, Eph4:13



// Sound doctrine is Any thing that focuses and teaches faith in christ.
// Sound doctrine is christ alone
 


// Trouble: means to loose your confidence
// Its the trace of another gospel that makes you loose your confidencd.


// In the light that we have which 


// our developement of that light will be development in spiritual realities 

// the light that we walk in is the light of the father

// 1jh1:5 God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.





// "phos"-- the sources of light


// the source of light will have no trace of darkness.
// We are im fellowship

// Fellowship simply means that we sharing something.ComponentWhen i say i have fellowshipped with him, thart  mean he has given me himself.


// God is light, and so he has shared with us light .

// the light jesus mentioned is the light of God. 
//  The light gives us access.

//  Fromthe day aman is born again, he has received the light of life. We dont receive more light after the new birth.

//  If light comes to anywhere at all, it will be in your understanding. your thinking.
//  the man who is born again has been lit up forever. 



 

//  Amos3:7



//  John 14:16

//  v18-20. 
//  The fellowship of the fahter is in us.
//  we are in fellowship wth the father. 
//  v17 dwells with you and be in you 
//  v16 abide with you-- exist in you same in matt1:23
//  matt28:20 lo i am with you

//  v20
//  to know--- to learn
//  realisation af whta already exists.

//  The teaching of the word makesyou realise that you are in the fellowship with the father that the father exists in you 


// We come into that knowledge so that we have direction


// jh17:3
// The issue here so far is that there is clarity  and in clarity is no darknes at all.


// This is fellowship with the father. the fellowship with the father is unique. there is noo darkness at all.
